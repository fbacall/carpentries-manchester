# Welcome!
Find out what is happening in the University of Manchester's Carpentry community.

# What are The Carpentries?
[The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) teach foundational computational, coding, and data science skills to researchers worldwide with no or minimal prior programming knowledge who find themselves increasingly having to write code to conduct their work. 

The Carpentries project was formed in Janury 2018 by formally merging [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) and [Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/). There are now many more new and emerging Carpentries, such as [Library Carpentry](https://librarycarpentry.github.io/) and [HPC Carpentry](https://hpc-carpentry.github.io/), which are all coming together under the umbrella of The Carpentries. These are all communities of practice - consisting of volunteer instructors, trainers, maintainers, helpers, and supporters who all share a mission to teach scientists best practices in writing clean, reproducible and robust code.

Software Carpentry (since early 2000s) focuses on conveying the best practices in programming and writing clean, reproducible and robust code to analyse data regardless of the tools used. In general, topics that are covered by the [core Software Carpentry curriculum](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/) include:

- Automating repetitive tasks - using UNIX Shell
- Code version control, sharing and collaboration - using git/GitHub or Mercurial
- An introduction to programming and best practices - using R or Python 

Data Carpentry (since 2014) teaches particular and recommended open source tools to do reproducible and scalable data analysis. In general, topics that are covered by [the core Data Carpentry curriculum](http://www.datacarpentry.org/lessons/) include:

- Best practices in data organization using spreadsheets
- Data cleaning - using OpenRefine
- Data management with SQL
- Data analysis and visualisation - using R or Python
